## Summary of Project
#### Description üìù: 
This project involves extracting data from Coinmarketcap API in PowerBI itself using Python script data source. I used Python script in PowerBI to extract data from API and clean up the data using PowerQuery. On this project i used basic DAX functions to create a measure and metrics. I also scheduled refresh for this dashboard, so it will automatically refresh 8 times a day. For the design part i created my own background for the visuals using PowerPoint.

#### Data Sources üìÇ:
The data was extracted from Coinmarketcap API using Python script in PowerBI, i removed and renamed columns, and the table contains these column: id, name (name of the cryptocurency), symbol (symbol of the cryptocurrency), slug, num_market_pairs, date_added, max_supply, circulating_supply, total_supply, infinite_supply, cmc_rank, price, volume_24h, volume_change_24h, percent_change_1h/24h/7d/30d/60d/90d, market_cap.

#### Files üìÅ:
`data_script.py`: This file contains code that i used to extract data from API in PowerBI. In PowerBI i chose `Python script` data source and i inserted code from `data_script.py`
`crypto_dashboard.pbix`: This file is the PowerBI dashboard

#### Skills&Technologies üéì: 
Data visualization, data cleaning, extracting data, PowerBI, PowerQuery, DAX, Python API, PowerPoint

#### Results üìà:
A dashboard that updates automatically 8 times a day, i can get quick insights about the market (about 5000 coins), i can track my favorite cryptocurrencies in a format convenient for me.
